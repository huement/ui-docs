    | Likely the most important aspect of any site is the typography. It makes up every element, is the most prevelant, and is the biggest conveyor of information. It should receive the most care and dedication until every letter is perfect.

    ## Lead
    Make a paragraph stand out by adding `.lead`.

  :codeblock(lang="html",class="padded")
    <p class="lead">
      This is a lead paragraph. It stands out from regular paragraphs.
    </p>

    ## Inline text elements
    Styling for common inline HTML5 elements.

  :codeblock(lang="html",class="padded")
    <p>You can use the mark tag to <mark>highlight</mark> text.</p>
    <p><del>This line of text is meant to be treated as deleted text.</del></p>
    <p><s>This line of text is meant to be treated as no longer accurate.</s></p>
    <p><ins>This line of text is meant to be treated as an addition to the document.</ins></p>
    <p><u>This line of text will render as underlined</u></p>
    <p><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
    <p><strong>This line rendered as bold text.</strong></p>
    <p><em>This line rendered as italicized text.</em></p>

  :markdownify()
    `.mark` and `.small` classes are also available to apply the same styles as `<mark>` and `<small>` while avoiding any unwanted semantic implications that the tags would bring.

    While not shown above, feel free to use `<b>` and `<i>` in HTML5. `<b>` is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance while `<i>` is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.

    ## Text utilities

    Change text alignment, transform, style, weight, and color with our [text utilities](/utilities/text) and [color utilities](/utilities/colors).

    ## Abbreviations

    Stylized implementation of HTML's `<abbr>` element for abbreviations and acronyms to show the expanded version on hover. Abbreviations have a default underline and gain a help cursor to provide additional context on hover and to users of assistive technologies.

    Add `.initialism` to an abbreviation for a slightly smaller font-size.

  :codeblock(lang="html",class="padded")
    <p><abbr title="attribute">attr</abbr></p>
    <p><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" class="initialism">HTML</abbr></p>

  :markdownify()
    ## Blockquotes
    For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document. Wrap `<blockquote class="blockquote">` around any <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> as the quote.

  :codeblock(lang="html",class="padded")
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      <p class="mb-0">A well-known quote, contained in a blockquote element.</p>
    </blockquote>
